# __Investigating the network of items frequently bought together when shopping in Danish grocery stores__

This project aims to get valuable insights into consumer behaviour in Denmark by investigating a network of common everyday-food-items that are bought together when grocery shopping in some of the biggest and well known grocery stores owned by the salling group.
The idea behind the project is to investigate if purchasing decisions are influenced by social and cultural norms and get insights into how these purchasing trends and societal dynamics are associated with the types of foods the average consumer decides to buy together when shopping.

# __Project Scope__

In the following pages, we will conduct a thorough assesment of three main areas:

1. How the data used in the study is collected using webscraping tools on the [**BilkaToGo website**](https://www.bilkatogo.dk/) and calling the [**Salling Group API**](https://developer.sallinggroup.com/api-reference).
2. A Network Analysis exploring degree distribution and assortativity, and the identification of communities and central food items within the network.
3. Using NLP-tools to analyze the product descriptions, to identify the words that are unique to each community within the network, providing insights into consumer buying patterns and the characteristics of frequently bought-together products.
