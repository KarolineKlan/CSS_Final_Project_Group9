# __Investigating the network of items frequently bought together when shopping in Danish grocery stores__

This project aims to get valuable insights into consumer behaviour in Denmark by investigating a network of common everyday-food-items that are bought together when grocery shopping in some of the biggest and well known grocery stores owned by the salling group.
The idea behind this project is to investigate whether purchasing decisions are influenced by social and cultural norms and to gain insights into how these are associated with the types of foods consumers typically buy together. By applying a social science approach to analyze this network, we aim to discover how consumer choices are reflected in the products that typically end in the same basket when grocery shopping.

# __Project Scope__

In the following pages, we will conduct a thorough assesment of three main areas:

1. **Data Collection:** Detailing the methods used to collect data, including web scraping tools applied to the [**BilkaToGo website**](https://www.bilkatogo.dk/) and calls made to the [**Salling Group API**](https://developer.sallinggroup.com/api-reference).
2. **Network Analysis:** Exploring degree distribution, assortativity, and identifying communities and central food items within the network to understand the structure and key components.
3. **Text Analysis:** Utilizing NLP tools to analyze product descriptions, identifying unique words for each community within the network, and providing insights into consumer buying patterns and the characteristics of frequently bought-together products.
